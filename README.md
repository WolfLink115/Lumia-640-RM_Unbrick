## Unbrick Guide

Put the ffufile and emergency files in a folder.
Rename the ffufile to ffufile.ffu

Copy and paste thor2.exe from "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Care Suite\Windows Device Recovery Tool" // If on 64-bit Windows
                              "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Care Suite\Windows Device Recovery Tool" // If on 32-bit Windows
To the folder with the files.

Now open cmd as admin and run:
```cmd
thor2 -mode emergency -hexfile MPRG8x26_fh.ede -edfile RM1113_fh.edp -ffufile ffufile.ffu
```

And wait for it to flash the bootloader and ffu.

When it is finished, run:
```cmd
thor2 -mode rnd -bootnormalmode

```
If your device goes back to flash mode, Use Windows Phone Internals to flash the ffu again.

## I would like to ask if anyone has any bricked Lumia devices, and has managed to unbrick them to please let me know which files were used, that way I can add them here for others who possibly need it. Thank you all!
